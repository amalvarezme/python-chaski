    "ChaskiNode is a Python framework for creating distributed network applications\n",
    "with a focus on ease of use, scalability, and performance. It provides an\n",
    "infrastructure for writing applications that operate as a network of nodes,\n",
    "where each node can communicate with others to exchange data and perform tasks\n",
    "concurrently and asynchronously. ChaskiNode leverages Pythonâ€™s asyncio library\n",
    "to handle network communication and concurrency, and it supports multiple\n",
    "protocols such as TCP and UDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework simplifies the development of networked applications by\n",
    "abstracting the complexities of asynchronous I/O operations, connection\n",
    "management, and message serialization/deserialization. It also includes a set of\n",
    "tools for tasks such as network discovery, latency measurements, and error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers can use ChaskiNode to build a variety of distributed systems,\n",
    "including but not limited to peer-to-peer networks, client-server architectures,\n",
    "and publish-subscribe models. With ChaskiNode, developers can focus on the core\n",
    "logic of their applications while relying on a robust and efficient network layer."
