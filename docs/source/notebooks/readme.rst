Chaski Confluent
================

ChaskiNode is a Python framework for creating distributed network
applications with a focus on ease of use, scalability, and performance.
It provides an infrastructure for writing applications that operate as a
network of nodes, where each node can communicate with others to
exchange data and perform tasks concurrently and asynchronously.
ChaskiNode leverages Pythonâ€™s asyncio library to handle network
communication and concurrency, and it supports multiple protocols such
as TCP and UDP.

This framework simplifies the development of networked applications by
abstracting the complexities of asynchronous I/O operations, connection
management, and message serialization/deserialization. It also includes
a set of tools for tasks such as network discovery, latency
measurements, and error handling.

Developers can use ChaskiNode to build a variety of distributed systems,
including but not limited to peer-to-peer networks, client-server
architectures, and publish-subscribe models. With ChaskiNode, developers
can focus on the core logic of their applications while relying on a
robust and efficient network layer.
